            <h1 class="project_section_title">Renting is frustrating</h1>
            <p class="project_text">With housing prices on the rise, renting is becoming a reality for more and more people. Yet the process of renting hasn’t changed much in the past few years, it’s still a shot in the dark for most people and it’s only getting harder - especially in the context of moving from city to city and having to find a place remotely. <br><br>

            Zillow is the most visited real estate site in the US, but with homeownership trending down, it’s critical to capture the emerging rental market. Especially since eventually these renters will become buyers in the future, and providing a service that meets their needs will not only bring value to the user, but also to Zillow's ecosystem as a business and brand. <br><br>

            <h1 class="project_section_title">Getting to know our audience</h1>
            <p class="project_text">We went into the rental market looking for an emerging, underserved audience. Following Ideo’s "<a href="http://www.designkit.org/methods/45" class="in-text-link" target="_blank">Extremes and Mainstreams</a>" methodology, we targetted the extreme use case of people moving from city to city and searching for places remotely. If the design resolved very stressful experiences, then casual users would also find it easier to use.
            </p>
            <img src="img/zillow/ourfocus_audience.png" alt="infographic of our target audience" class="intext_image">

             <p class="project_text">Some insights from our guerrilla user interviews regarding this frustration:<br><br>
                  -<i>"I had no idea about neighbourhoods. Would I be close to a grocery store, bar, park?"</i><br>
                -<i>"Before I moved I was very frustrated with not being able to see places in person. I’m highly interested in the cultural significance of a neighbourhood, and wanted to explore where I would be living."</i><br>
                -<i>"Finding this place was a lot of searching on Craigslist, and emailing, and hearing nothing back."</i><br>
                -<i>"I kept track of [listings I emailed] with a google spreadsheet."</i><br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="project_section_title">Lessons from other domains</h2>
            <p class="project_text">We looked into dating apps and their approach to connect people to people. Dating apps have a sense of emotional depth and a groundwork for finding people or places within very specific parameters. What if we took a similar approach when connecting people to places, in order to create a more personal experience? <br><br>

            By taking a HCD (human-centered design) approach, we reframed rental platforms as services that connect people to their ideal place through a “match-making” process. Other rental platforms primarily provide search functions for users based on just price and location. But in Zillow Places, there’s more emphasis on personalization based on people’s qualitative needs, and thus the process of finding a home is more personalized, photo-centric, and has a curated feel.<br><br>

We really wanted to show context of the neighbourhood and the surroundings, to give users a more realistic perception of the area - as if they were getting insight from a local.<br><br>

            We also surface geotagged Instagram photos of the area so that the user gets authentic views of the neighbourhood from other locals besides the lister.</p>

            We've provided both a chat interface, and video call feature to facilitate a trustworthy and transparent line of communication between the lister and the renter, and to provide an opportunity for a virtual tour of the place as well.</p>

            Explore shows places outside a user’s parameters through "Neighbourhoods" and "Collections", in case they are not exactly sure what they are looking for. It helps users get an idea of the kinds of places the city has to offer. Neighbourhoods are groupings of places based on location and proximity. Collections are curated places which share certain characteristics, like age, size, or style.</p>

            The user can navigate between the main states by swiping left/right, or by tapping on the icons on the top corners of the global nav. This builds off of an interaction pattern found in many current apps.
