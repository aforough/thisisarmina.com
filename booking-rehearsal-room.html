                  <h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
                    <p>Just to provide some background information on my process - I was doing an internship at Philips Lighting. So I worked 9-5 every day and had to schedule and manage my time accordingly. I finished this project in 18 hours over the span of 3 days.</p>

            <h2>Dissecting the brief</h2>
            <p>
              With every brief I get, I start my process with asking questions to dissect the brief. Here are some of the questions that I asked in the beginning of my process:<br><br>

              <b>1. Who is the primary user of this reservation system?</b> <br><br>
              <b>2. What form/channel could be the most suitable for this journey? Is it a single or a mixed channel experience?</b><br><br>
              <b>3. If it’s an app, would it just be dedicated to the reservation process? Or would it be a more holistic platform?</b>
            </p><br><br>

            <h2>User interviews</h2>
            <p>It’s always important to me to ground my designs in real life scenarios, so after an initial round of ideation I conducted 15 minute interviews with 4 people to ask about their room booking experience — 3 are enrolled in SFU’s contemporary music & composition program, and 1 is an intern at Philips Lighting. Moving forward I decided to scope down the project and design a system that could potentially be implemented for SFU's music department, since I noticed interesting opportunity areas from my interviews.</p><br><br>

            <h2>3 Attributes that I thought the booking system should have based on my research:</h2>

         <div class="project_content">
           <h2>User flows + ideation</h2>
           <p>At this point, I started structuring what the user flow could look like before starting to design screens. This approach allowed me to consider pre and post-booking experience in my design process.</p><br><br>

            <p>Main users can log in using their student or faculty number and password - not just for convenience also for security purposes to make sure the rooms are booked by members.
              I will take you through the journey from Melissa’s point of view - a composition student studying at SFU. Her goal is to book a room to work on her composition piece.<br><br>

            On the home page, she is able to see her class schedule for the day and the assignments that are due for each class. If she has booked a room, she’ll see it there as well.</p>

            <p>Floating action button will initiate the booking flow. The image placeholder at the top of room cards is for an interior map of the campus as the first image, highlighting where the room is located, as well as a couple of other photos of the room in a carousel.<br><br>
              <b>Insight: One-day & multi-day booking —</b> Through user interviews I found that music students sometimes have a certain piece that they work on for a number of days. Based on that behavior, I implemented a toggle-like feature that lets them book a room for a specific number of days for ongoing rehearsals.

            Filter rooms</h2>

            <p>Melissa is able to filter rooms based on parameters such as the time frame, number of people, and available instruments in the room.<br><br>
              <b>Challenge: choice of hiding the the filter elements vs. exposing them —</b> I went through 3 different iterations for the filter design, where I iterated between showing all the filter elements and parameters right above the room cards vs. having an overlay dedicated to them. I decided to go with the overlay since it clusters information better, and having all the filters exposed both pushes the available rooms down the page and is overwhelming at first glance.

               Unlock door</h2>
              <p>When Melissa arrives to the room, she can enter the code that she received in her confirmation email to unlock the door. That code is only active during her booked time and will changed for the next person. If there are technical difficulties, she can contact the help number provided on the top right.<br><br>

              <b>Why a smart lock? </b>Based on user interviews, I found that in the current process at SFU, music students are only let in the rehearsal rooms by a security guard. In other words, the security guard needs to leave their room in order to unlock the door with their own keys, since there is only one set of them available. I took this opportunity to propose a system makes the process faster by removing the middleman without compromising security.

           Spontaneous room booking at the door</h2>
            <p>Having a tablet installed near the room’s door opens up the opportunity to design a more flexible booking system by providing for another entry point to the booking journey. <br><br>When Melissa has a break in between her classes and wants spontaneously book a specific room to practice, she is able to check out the schedule and book a time slot right at the door with her student number.</p>

            My work strategy is keeping the mock-ups and wireframes low-fidelity as long as possible, because it removes all the distractions and is faster to iterate on. If I were to continue this project, the next step forward would be to test these interactive prototypes and do another iteration at higher-fidelity and based on the testing insights.
